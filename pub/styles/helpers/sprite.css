/*
LESS variables are information about icon's compiled state, stored under its original file name

.icon-home {
  width: @icon-home-width;
}

The large array-like variables contain all information about a single icon
@icon-home: x y offset_x offset_y width height total_width total_height image_path name;

At the bottom of this section, we provide information about the spritesheet itself
@spritesheet: width height image @spritesheet-sprites;
*/
/*
These "retina group" variables are mappings for the naming and pairing of normal and retina sprites.

The list formatted variables are intended for mixins like `retina-sprite` and `retina-sprites`.
*/
/*
The provided classes are intended to be used with the array-like variables

.icon-home {
  .sprite-width(@icon-home);
}
.icon-email {
  .sprite(@icon-email);
}

Example usage in HTML:

`display: block` sprite:
<div class="icon-home"></div>

To change `display` (e.g. `display: inline-block;`), we suggest using a common CSS class:

// CSS
.icon {
  display: inline-block;
}

// HTML
<i class="icon icon-home"></i>
*/
/*
The `retina-sprite` class sets up rules and a media query for a sprite/retina sprite.
  It should be used with a "retina group" variable.

The media query is from CSS Tricks: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/retina-display-media-query/

@icon-home-group: 'icon-home' @icon-home @icon-home-2x;

.icon-home {
  .retina-sprite(@icon-home-group);
}
*/
/*
The `.sprites` mixin generates identical output to the CSS template
  but can be overridden inside of LESS

This must be run when you have at least 2 sprites.
  If run with a single sprite, then there will be reference errors.

.sprites(@spritesheet-sprites);
*/
/*
The `.retina-sprites` mixin generates a CSS rule and media query for retina groups
  This yields the same output as CSS retina template but can be overridden in LESS

.retina-sprites(@retina-groups);
*/
